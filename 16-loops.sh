# Loops : When you want to run an action for certain number of times, we use for loops.

# There are 2 major types of loops ;
#     1) For loop       ( When you know something to be executed n number of time, we use for loop)
#     2) While loop     ( When you don't know something to be executed n number of times, we use while loop)
 
#echo value is 10
#echo value is 20
#echo value is 30
#echo value is 40
#echo value is 50

# for loop syntax
for i in 10 20 30 40 50 ; do
    echo "Values from the loops are $i"
done
